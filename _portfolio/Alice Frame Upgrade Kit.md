## Problem Statement
The MOLLE-4K rucksack, standard issue for U.S. Army soldiers, is known for being fragile and uncomfortable on long missions. This project, in collaboration with the 101st Airborne Division and EagleWerx Innovation, aimed to create an ergonomic, field-ready frame upgrade that could be easily integrated with existing MOLLE-4K packs using legacy ALICE frames.

## Features

* **Height Adjustable Kit**: Retrofit kit allows custom sizing via aluminum slide-on tubes and a modular center beam. Soldiers can lengthen or shorten their frames by up to 7 inches using only basic tools.
* **Field Tested**: Kit underwent field testing with soldiers during a 25+ mile ruck and a month-long deployment simulation. Design feedback was collected and implemented in real time.
* **Durable & Lightweight**: Constructed from 6061 T6 aluminum to match military durability standards while maintaining low weight. Withstood FEA simulations of high-stress loading conditions.
* **Human-Centered Design**: Co-developed with soldier feedback, the frame also includes a removable cloth hygiene pouch for quick-access storage.
* **Scalable**: Designed for under $50 per unit, packaged in a laser-cut MDF kit box with cutting guides, fasteners, and all necessary components.

## Timeline
Project began August 2024 and concludes with Vanderbilt Design Day in April 2025. Currently undergoing final testing and commercialization steps.
