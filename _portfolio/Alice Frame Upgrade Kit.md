## Problem Statement
The U.S. Army’s MOLLE-4K rucksack, while intended as a modern solution, has earned criticism for its discomfort, fragility, and poor fit under heavy loads. Soldiers reported frame breakages during missions and difficulty adjusting the pack to fit their bodies—especially over long rucks with 70–100 lb loads. Our team partnered with the 101st Airborne Division and EagleWerx at Fort Campbell to develop an ergonomic upgrade that could be field-ready, low-cost, and compatible with issued gear.

Rather than reinventing the entire frame, we created a modular kit that retrofits the battle-tested ALICE frame. By preserving its trusted durability and adding height adjustability and comfort upgrades, the kit offers a customizable, cost-effective solution soldiers can trust and modify with minimal tools in the field.

## Features

* **Fully Adjustable Fit**  
  The kit includes two slide-on aluminum rods and a customizable center beam that lets soldiers tailor the frame height to their body. Adjustment ranges from -2 to +5 inches from the standard height, enhancing both comfort and load distribution.

* **Military-Grade Durability**  
  Made from 6061 T6 aluminum, the modified frame is built to endure harsh conditions. FEA testing validated its ability to withstand real-world forces and identified high-stress areas, allowing for reinforced design choices like center beam optimization.

* **Soldier-Tested, Field-Validated**  
  Frames were tested by soldiers in month-long offsite rucks, with real-time feedback informing design tweaks. Collaboration with EagleWerx ensured the product was engineered for real mission environments.

* **Complete Retrofit Kit**  
  Includes everything needed to upgrade a standard ALICE frame: adjustable rods, custom center beam, hygiene pouch, cutting guides, hardware, and a laser-cut MDF packaging box. Assembly is simple, requires minimal tools, and can be done in the field.

* **Human-Centered and Scalable**  
  Designed around soldier comfort, mobility, and mission-readiness. The kit costs under $50 to produce and fits seamlessly into existing gear ecosystems—making it viable for mass deployment or individual aftermarket upgrades.
