## Problem Statement
The U.S. Army’s MOLLE-4K rucksack frame, while intended as a modern solution, has been widely criticized for its discomfort, fragility, and poor fit during extended use. Soldiers frequently report frame breakages and difficulty achieving a proper fit—particularly on long rucks carrying 70–100 lb loads. Our team partnered with the 101st Airborne Division and EagleWerx at Fort Campbell to develop a modular frame upgrade that is field-ready, low-cost, and compatible with issued equipment.

Rather than designing an entirely new frame, we created a retrofit kit that builds on the durability of the classic ALICE frame, widely trusted by soldiers since the 1970s. By enhancing comfort and enabling basic adjustability, our kit offers a simple, effective solution that can be assembled in the field with minimal tools — and never needs to be reassembled once installed.

## Features

* **Comfort-First Design**  This frame significantly improves soldier comfort and reduces fatigue on long rucks. The custom-fit upgrade reduces pressure points and hot spots that commonly occur with MOLLE-4K frames, especially under load.

* **Field-Set, Fixed-Length Adjustability**  Early prototypes explored sliding aluminum rods for on-the-fly adjustment. After testing, we pivoted to a simpler, more robust approach: fixed adjustability during assembly. Soldiers can select a frame length that fits their body (−2 to +5 inches from standard height) and permanently secure it. Once set, no further adjustments are needed, simplifying use and improving durability.

* **Military-Grade Durability**  Fabricated from 6061 T6 aluminum, the frame is designed to withstand extreme conditions. FEA simulations validated the load-bearing strength and informed key reinforcements. The center beam, often a weak point in other designs, is optimized for rigidity and stress distribution.

* **Soldier-Tested, Field-Validated**  Frames were used in real military training - on both a 25-mile ruck and during a month-long deployment simulation with the 101st. Feedback was incorporated after each test cycle to refine fit, performance, and ease of assembly.

* **Complete Retrofit Kit**  The full kit includes precision-cut aluminum components, a custom hygiene pouch, cutting guides, hardware, and packaging. Designed to be intuitive and soldier-proof, the kit assembles in under 30 minutes and never requires rework. Once installed, it’s built to last for years under active-duty use. The kit is expected to retail for $50, with the option to bundle an ALICE frame for an additional $100. Soldiers often spend hundreds of dollars each year on aftermarket equipment and expressed high interest in our product at this price point.
