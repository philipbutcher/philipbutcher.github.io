## Problem Statement
The U.S. Army’s MOLLE-4K rucksack frame, while intended as a modern solution, has been widely criticized for its discomfort, fragility, and poor fit during extended use. Soldiers frequently report frame breakages and difficulty achieving a proper fit — particularly on long marches with loads up to 100 lbs. Our team partnered with the 101st Airborne Division and EagleWerx at Fort Campbell to develop a modular frame upgrade that is field-ready, low-cost, and compatible with issued equipment.

Rather than designing an entirely new frame, we created a retrofit kit that modifies the classic ALICE frame — a legacy design trusted by soldiers since the 1970s. The kit allows users to cut their existing frame in half, slide on two aluminum extension rods and a custom center beam, and reassemble the frame at a length tailored to their body. The components are secured using pre-drilled holes, bolts, and a provided cutting guide. Once set, the frame stays locked in place permanently — no readjustment or reassembly required.

## Features

* **Modular Retrofit Solution**  The kit transforms a standard ALICE frame into a height-adjustable, mission-ready solution. By cutting the frame and attaching included aluminum components, soldiers can extend or shorten the frame by up to 7 inches (−2 to +5 inches from standard height) to better match their body type.

* **Comfort-First Design**  This upgrade significantly improves comfort during long rucks. The frame better distributes load weight, reduces pressure points, and eliminates hotspots commonly reported with the MOLLE-4K. Feedback from soldiers highlighted noticeable fatigue reduction.

* **Durable and Field-Ready**  Built from 6061 T6 aluminum, the kit is engineered to endure harsh field conditions. FEA simulations validated the structural integrity under high stress, and reinforcements like the optimized center beam improve long-term durability.

* **One-Time Assembly, Zero Maintenance**  With help from a provided cutting guide and standard tools, the kit can be installed in under 30 minutes. Once assembled, no additional adjustments or replacements are needed — the frame is ready for years of active-duty use.

* **Soldier-Tested, Mission-Validated**   The design was refined through real-world testing, including 25-mile rucks and a month-long offsite training exercise with the 101st Airborne Division. Continuous feedback ensured the final version met actual soldier needs in operational conditions.

* **Affordable and Scalable**  The full kit includes aluminum components, a hygiene pouch, cutting guides, hardware, and packaging — all for an estimated retail price of $50. With an optional $100 ALICE frame add-on, it’s an accessible solution in a market where soldiers already spend hundreds annually on aftermarket upgrades.
