## Problem
The Metro-Nashville SWAT Unit purchased several DJI Avata drones to provide visuals of indoor environments when it could be dangerous for officers to enter. The drones are flown using a handheld controller, and the camera feed is sent to a pair of goggles worn by the operator. The officers wear Kevlar helmets equipped with over-ear headphones and batteries. However, the drone goggles are not designed for integration with their helmet gear, and current methods of securing them to the eyes—such as using string, rubber bands, or a sewn-on elastic band—do not provide a secure connection. This results in compromised control of the drone. The SWAT unit seeks a quick and secure method of holding the goggles to the officers’ faces.


## Solution


The plan was to create a widely accessible, single-component 3D-printed plastic mount that would tightly secure the goggles at one end and clip into the standard NVG Wilcox Mount on the officer's helmet at the other. First, the goggles were scanned with a FARO Arm, and the 3D rendering was imported into SolidWorks, where the mount was designed. Priority was placed on a strong hold of the goggles and a minimally invasive design. Other factors included protecting the front face of the goggles from potential collisions and reinforcing areas susceptible to breaking. Many prototypes were designed, printed, and tested. The final product has been very well received by the Metro-Nashville PD, who took it to a local police convention to create awareness. 231 enforcement agencies across 39 states and 13 countries are now using the mount, including federal, state, and local agencies, as well as anti-terrorism agencies in the United Kingdom, Spain, Netherlands, France, and the Czech Republic. The stl. file remains free to download, and this list is expected to continue growing through word of mouth.
