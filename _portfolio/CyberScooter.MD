Syringe pumps are precision devices that use a motor-driven lead screw to deliver controlled amounts of fluid, ensuring accuracy and sterility. They are essential in medical and scientific fields, but despite their simple design, they can cost hundreds of dollars, making custom fabrication a worthwhile option. As a design challenge for class, a custom syringe pump was created using 3D-printed parts. A stepper motor drove the lead screw, and an Arduino program allowed for the adjustable flow rate. The pump featured user-friendly controls with indicator LEDs, a motor cutoff when out of liquid, and durable, water-resistant wiring. The entire build could be assembled and taken apart without glue or hammering of components.
