## Problem

Dr. Ryan Martin is an associate professor and experienced surgeon in the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at Vanderbilt University Hospital. He specializes in total knee replacement surgeries, which involve replacing a damaged knee joint with an artificial joint typically comprised of a tibial and femoral implant. It is hypothesized that these artificial joints often fail due to lipid contamination between the tibial implant and the bone cement applied to the tibia. Through Dr. Martin’s lab research, he believes the lateral surface patterns of the tibial implant have a direct correlation to the percentage of lipid contamination at the surface, with lower percentages resulting in higher pullout forces and an increased lifespan of the implant. While current market implants have varying success rates at mitigating lipid contamination, he believes their designs could be improved upon. The plan is to generate radically new tibial knee inserts, with the design goal of minimizing fluid movement around the implant.



## Solution


First, previous academic journals of Dr. Martin were read to familiarize myself with knee replacement surgery, implant designs, and lipid contamination. From there, a replica of the current best-performing tibial implant on the market was designed in SolidWorks. The implant features a flat, bean-shaped bottom with a cone protruding from the middle and four divots at the base. Two experimental designs were created following a similar shape profile with differing surface patterns - one with a honeycomb hexagonal pattern, and the other with four guided paths down the central protruding cone. The three designs were 3D printed using the Stratasys F120, and silicone molds were created to cast clear epoxy models of the implants. Testing began with a thick layer of white clay inserted into the silicone molds of the implants, and a divot created to add several drops of red-dyed canola oil to mimic the lipid contamination. The clear implant was then fully inserted into the mold and gently rocked back and forth for 60 seconds, with the fluid spread being observed. The goal was to minimize liquid movement. The experimental designs both performed noticeably better than the current leading tibial implants. 

###### While studies are ongoing, the experimental implants have been featured in the academic manuscript "Do Cement Pockets Prevent Fluid Contamination of the Undersurface of Tibial Baseplates?“ which is has been accepted for publication by the [Journal of Clinical and Translational Research](https://www.jctres.com/media/filer_public/21/55/21553102-8ab8-4090-bd25-c4bf975f3d22/3_jctr_v10i4_005_-_proof_30_finalized.pdf).
