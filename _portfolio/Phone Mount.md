## About
This project was modeled in Fusion 360 using a concept called “Top-Down Modeling”. This technique involves building each component of the device within the same CAD file, using the previous components as reference points. This allows for not only a quick design time, but often better fit and alignment between parts as they are created within the context of each other. There were three main design criteria for this design project. First, the mount had to easily attach to my bike without damaging or permanently altering the handles. Additionally, it had to be able to easily grip my phone, as well as rotate my phone between its vertical and horizontal position. 

## Design Process

To achieve this design, the dimensions of my handle were recorded with calipers. In Fusion 360, an arm was extended for where the phone would sit. The mount featured two distinct components that were press fit together to create a permanent part. To create rotation, a wheeled mechanism with teeth at 90-degree intervals was created, allowing for precise rotation of the phone (see image below). With the design complete, the parts were powder printed on the Formlabs Fuse 1 using Nylon 12. This type of 3D printing allowed for uniform part strength, as well as an appealing, matte gray surface finish on the parts. Once printed, the two components were cleaned of residual powder, and then press fit together. To attach to the bike, an M6 screw was tightened around the clamping mechanism, and a foam insert was glued to the mount to cushion the phone while riding.
