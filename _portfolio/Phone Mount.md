## About
This project was modeled in Fusion 360 using a concept called “Top-Down Modeling”. This technique involves building each component of the device within the same CAD file, using the previous components as reference points. This technique not only reduces design time but also improves fit and alignment by designing parts within their context. Three design parameters defined this project. First, the mount had to easily attach to my bike without damaging or permanently altering the handles. "Additionally, it needed to securely grip my phone and allow for rotation between vertical and horizontal positions

## Design Process

To achieve this design, the dimensions of my handle were recorded with calipers. In Fusion 360, an arm was extended for where the phone would sit. The mount featured two distinct components that were press fit together to create a permanent part. Rotation was achieved using a wheeled mechanism with teeth at 90-degree intervals, enabling precise phone positioning (see image below). With the design complete, the parts were powder printed on the Formlabs Fuse 1 using Nylon 12. This type of 3D printing allowed for uniform part strength, as well as an appealing, matte gray surface finish on the parts. After printing, the components were cleaned of residual powder and press-fit together. To attach to the bike, an M6 screw was tightened around the clamping mechanism, and a foam insert was glued to the mount to cushion the phone while riding.
