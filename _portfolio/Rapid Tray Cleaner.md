## Problem

Radical Shoots is a Nashville-based company that grows microgreens (young seedlings of fruits and vegetables) for restaurants and consumers. The microgreens are grown out of 10”x20” plastic trays which collect mold, dirt, and dead plant matter. Consequently, the trays must be cleaned after every use, resulting in the company devoting hours a week toward hand washing 200+ trays. This is slow, unorganized, and lacks standardization. Furthermore, with the company based out of a greenhouse open to customers, manually scrubbing the trays has caused customers to distrust the cleanliness of the produce, resulting in lower sales. Radical Shoots needs a consistent and efficient way to keep trays clean because current methods are labor-intensive, aesthetically displeasing, and make standardization difficult.


## Solution

After defining the problem, the ideation phase began with a variety of designs considered. UV light, disposable trays, motorized machines, and outsourcing were all explored. It was quickly realized the device needed to be simple and cheap enough to manufacture within the allotted time frame (~2 months). The final design involved two mirrored flat brushes for the tray to be slid through, cleaning both sides simultaneously. An electric pump cycled water (with the option to add cleaning solution) through the bristles to help remove stuck-on dirt. A mesh wire sheet with magnets was attached over a bottom tray to collect the fallen dirt and debris while still allowing the water to pass through. The components were attached using aluminum extrusions, and acrylic panels were laser cut to mitigate splashing and add to the aesthetic appeal of the device. Although it required a person to operate, the device cleaned the trays faster and more consistently, while still providing an aesthetically pleasing process for customers to appreciate.
