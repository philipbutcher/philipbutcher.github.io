## Project Overview
Generative design is a computer modeling technique that allows for the creation of mechanical parts using loads and obstacle geometries. In traditional CAD modeling, a 3-dimensional part is created through a series of sketches and extrusions, with manual calculations used to determine the necessary dimensions of a part. With generative design, the required loads (such as forces and torques) are added at different points in a 3-dimensional space, and machine learning algorithms then generate a part to meet the given inputs. As a class project, a skateboard truck for an electric longboard was to be designed and 3D printed using this form of CAD modeling.

## Design Considerations
One critical component of the generative design process is the assignment of loads and constraints. Without any guidance, the computer cannot create a suitable component. Therefore, careful parameters were set when designing the skateboard truck. Constraint geometries, such as where the motor and wheels will rest, ensured that there would be no overlap of parts during installation. Furthermore, preserve geometries were defined to ensure proper fitment of the kingpin, wheels, and motor mounting plate. Typical forces felt by a skateboard were manually calculated and applied to their respective locations, such as the weight of the rider, turning, accelerating, and front/side impacts. A safety factor of 1.5 was added for additional structural support. 

## Final Result 
For this project, designs were created out of two materials, Nylon 12 and AlSi10Mg. Nylon 12, a strong and durable polymer, produced a lightweight and cost-effective design suitable for prototyping and low-load applications. It was chosen as this is the building material used in the Formlabs Fuse 1 SLS printer, but in reality, a stronger alloy such as AlSi10Mg would be used. Both designs were successfully installed and tested on the skateboard, demonstrating the practical engineering potential of generative design.
